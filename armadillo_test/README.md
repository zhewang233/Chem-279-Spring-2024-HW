### Description
This repository contains sample jobs designed for testing Armadillo, a high-quality C++ library for linear algebra and scientific computing. Among these, `inv_sqrt_S.cpp` serves as a specific example demonstrating how to calculate the inverse square root of an overlap matrix utilizing Armadillo's capabilities.

### Usage
To compile and run the example on Datahub, or any environment with g++ and Armadillo installed. Please follow:

`g++ -o arma_test <filename>.cpp -larmadillo && ./arma_test`
