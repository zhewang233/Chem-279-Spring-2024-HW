### Description
This repository contains sample inputs and outputs for the sixth problem set. Molecule inputs are contained in the `sample_input` directory. Corresponding outputs are contained in the `sample_output` directory, with different potential energy terms for debugging purpose. Main contributions from basis (nx, ny, nz) to occupied orbitals are listed in the outputs.
